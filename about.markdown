I am a postdoctoral researcher at California Institute of Technology(Caltech) working in the area of theoretical and computational chemistry. 

Research Themes: 

Ab-initio methods for the strong correlation problem

Tensor decomposition techniques and its application to quantum chemical methods

Machine Learning the 'Electron correlation problem'

I have contributed codes to quantum chemistry softwares such as [ACESII](http://www.qtp.ufl.edu/Aces/) and [MPQC](https://github.com/ValeevGroup/mpqc).

You can find the codes developed by me here:
